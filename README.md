Team repo for the hackathon on November 17-18, 2018, where we assess the impact of Russian trolls on the 2016 presidential election poll results.

The data generation, training, and base LSTM scripts were provided by the Stats 285 faculty at Stanford and can be found in the `master` branch with minor modifications made by Ji Won.

Don't forget to work in your own branch!

First, do
```
source configure.sh
```
in the root of this repo. All the data generation files as well as `ProjectTroll-master/train_LSTM.py` depend on the environment variable.

Then you can go to
```
cd ProjectTroll-master
```
and do whatever you want with the code!

Note: I nested the `ProjectTroll-master` folder so that we could put documentation in the repo root. Sorry for any inconvenience!
